The youngest son of construction magnate Pallonji Mistry, Cyrus Mistry was chosen as Tata's successor in November, 2011, and was appointed deputy chairman of Tata Sons and took over as the chairman of Tata Sons in 2012.

Mistry will remain a director on the board of Tata Sons till March 2017, a position he held before he became chairman. But he will have to quit as chairman of all group companies.   

The decision to replace Cyrus Mistry was performance-based.But I don’t think so it is the main reason according to the numbers the net profit at TCS has soared. It jumped about 75% between March 2013 and March 2016, while its revenue has grown 72%.

Tata Motors delivers the highest revenue of the Tata Group stocks.Its revenue has grown 46% between 2013 and 2016, while the net profit is up just 11.4% during the period.

However Tata Steel is worst performer of the three large Tata Group stocks because it is dragged down by its operations in the U.K. 

So based on the above numbers I don’t think that the performance is the main reason for the replacement.That a huge decision like this was taken by the Tatas can happen only for three reasons : 1.values, 2.trying to left the unprofitable things(Being practical against the company’s culture), 3.Try to do the things that you belive, that needed to change for sack of good but didn’t implement the all of your thoughts.

So let’s talk about the first aspect:value

The Tata Group is well known for their ethics and commitment but the legal battle with the Japanese company DoCoMo brougth out that wether they trust  Tata or not in terms of commitment.Because Tata Group hadn’t paid the amount of around $1 billion to DoCoMo as part of their agreement.And the outcome of this is that the DoCoMo is suing the Tata Group in a British court.

Second aspects:trying to left the unprofitable things(Being practical against the company’s culture)

Because of the bad timing and investment and sharp fall in global commodity prices and cheap Chinese imports have affected the company’s operations.The company is in huge loss, so Cyrus Mistry wants to sell the property want to be focused more on the emerging markets like India and less in Europe but that is against the culture of the Tata group and Tata group was not comfortable with the decision of the Cyrus Mistry.

Third aspects: try to do the things that you belive, that needed to change for sack of good but didn’t implement the all thoughts for that thing.

When Cyrus Mistry joined the Tata group as a chairman he realized that he needed to change the existing culture of the group and he had a good ideas to restructure the group .But being on focused on that aspect he mainly focused on the limited aspects of the business.And yes in some case he took a stand for what he believes like UK steel mill but it didn’t go well.
